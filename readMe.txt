In this project I use algoritm Dijkstra's algorithm for calculate the shortest way to product that i need. For this algoritm i use two loops "for(){}" inside each other
For this algoritm I use graph that give us information about the distance to every stock. 
After this i make loop for displaying stock. 
Also i make function makeOrder that add name and amount every product that i add to cart.
After this I make hashed order number that make buy simple hash function. the hash inculded string name and amount of product example "PCx1Casesx5"
